# Endless Runner Game

Welcome to my Endless Runner game, made with Unreal Engine 5.1.1 using C++ only! 

# Controls

These are the following controlls that you'll use

## Player 1 Controls
- **Space**: Jump
- **A Key**: Move left
- **D Key**: Move right

## Player 2 Controls
- **Up Arrow Key**: Jump
- **Left Arrow Key**: Move left
- **Right Arrow Key**: Move right

# Challenges Overcome

During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered and overcome. These include:

- **Dynamic Object Creation and Movement**: I had trouble creating and moving objects at the same time. But after some serious tinkering with the code and a lot of trial and error, I was able to get it working.

- **Player Movement and Game Difficulty**: Making the player run in place while the objects move towards the player created issues with creating new platforms and balancing the game difficulty. This issue still persists, but it is being dealt with.

- **Collision Detection**: Collision detection was a challenging task that required understanding of Unreal Engines physics and already implemented functions. With diligent testing and debugging, the code was optimized and the issue was overcome.

- **User Interface**: Implementing UI elements and updating the UI through C++ was a complex task. Through experimentation and thorough documentation, the task was completed successfully.

# Part 2

In part 2 of the project, I focused on improving the game's performance and adding new mechanics to enhance the gameplay experience. These changes include:

- Adding a highscore mechanic that saves locally to track the player's progress.
- Implementing 2 players into the game, with the second player's controls being left and right arrow keys to move and up arrow key to jump.
- Increasing the game's replay value by adding a new mechanic that spawns a coin with a 10-25% chance whenever the platform is dodged instead of despawning the obstacle.
- Fixing the issue with player movement and game difficulty by balancing the game difficulty and creating new platforms.

These improvements have resulted in a smoother and more enjoyable gameplay experience for the players. 

You can check out the updated version of the game in the Release section of this GitHub repository.
