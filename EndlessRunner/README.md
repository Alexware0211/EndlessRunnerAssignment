# Endless Runner Game

Welcome to my Endless Runner game, made with Unreal Engine 5.1.1 using C++ only! 

# Part 1

Part 1 of the project has been focused on adding the main gameplay mechanics into the game, resulting in a semi-polished, work-in-progress game. 

The game has been built from the ground up using C++ only, with no use of Blueprints. A variety of data structures and algorithms have been utilized to create a game with smooth and seamless gameplay mechanics.

# Controls

The game can be played using the following controls:

## Player 1 Controls
- **Space**: Jump
- **A Key**: Move left
- **D Key**: Move right

## Player 2 Controls
- **Up Arrow Key**: Jump
- **Left Arrow Key**: Move left
- **Right Arrow Key**: Move right

# Challenges Overcome

During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered and overcome. These include:

- **Dynamic Object Creation and Movement**: I had trouble creating and moving objects at the same time. But after some serious tinkering with the code and a lot of trial and error, I was able to get it working.

- **Player Movement and Game Difficulty**: Making the player run in place while the objects move towards the player created issues with creating new platforms and balancing the game difficulty. This issue still persists, but it is being dealt with.

- **Collision Detection**: Collision detection was a challenging task that required understanding of Unreal Engines physics and already implemented functions. With diligent testing and debugging, the code was optimized and the issue was overcome.

- **User Interface**: Implementing UI elements and updating the UI through C++ was a complex task. Through experimentation and thorough documentation, the task was completed successfully.

# Part 2

In part 2 of the project, I focused on improving the game's performance and adding new mechanics to enhance the gameplay experience. These changes include:

- Adding a highscore mechanic that saves locally to track the player's progress.
- Implementing 2 players into the game, with the second player's controls being left and right arrow keys to move and up arrow key to jump.
- Increasing the game's replay value by adding a new mechanic that spawns a coin with a 10-25% chance whenever the platform is dodged instead of despawning the obstacle.
- Fixing the issue with player movement and game difficulty by balancing the game difficulty and creating new platforms.

These improvements have resulted in a smoother and more enjoyable gameplay experience for the players. 

You can check out the updated version of the game in the Release section of this GitHub repository.

# Mechanics

| **Mechanics** | **Description** |
| :---: | :--- |
| Endless Runner | The game is an endless runner with no end goal other than to achieve a high score. |
| Obstacles | The game features obstacles that the player must avoid by jumping or sliding. |
| Coins | The game features coins that the player can collect for points. |
| Lives | The player has 3 lives, and losing all of them results in a game over. |
| Difficulty | The game gets progressively harder with speed. |
| Algorithm | The game uses an algorithm to randomize the placement and types of obstacles to keep the gameplay experience interesting and dynamic. |
| Highscore | The game saves the player's highscore locally. |
| Two Players | The game now supports two players. |
| Coin Spawn | Whenever the platform is dodged, there is a chance (10-25%) of spawning a coin instead of despawning the obstacle. |
| Improved Performance | The game's performance has been improved, resulting in a smoother gameplay experience. |

# Release
